To make a custom song, follow this format:

[Beginning of text file]
<songpath>
<notes>...
[End of text file]

The songpath is the path of the mp3 file relative to this file
A note is defined like so: GREEN;RED;YELLOW;BLUE;WAITUNTILNEXT
                  Example: 1;0;0;1;500
				  So this would have a green note, a blue note and would wait for 500 ms until the next note

Example:

[Beginning of text file]
song.mp3
1;0;0;1;500
[End of text file]
